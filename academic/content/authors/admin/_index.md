I am a PhD student in reinforcement learning at the [LiteRL](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/rlcdm/team/) group at TU Darmstadt in partnership with the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) lab and [Hessian.AI](https://hessian.ai/), supervised by Professor [Carlo D'Eramo](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/rlcdm/team/carlo-deramo/)üéì

I am interested in developing sample-efficient techniques in **deep reinforcement learning** using theoretical analyses from **game theory**üïπÔ∏è

I am a [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesianism), a [Continuum Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis) supporter, and a [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) sceptic.
